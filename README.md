> Drug Design 1 & 2: Professor Kalju Kahn *(kalju\@chem.ucsb.edu)*
>
> To teach principles that governs the process of modern drug discovery

> taken by real-life drug developers by learning important elements of
> the drug design process in a logical order.
>
> This course is an overview of the process whereby one identi\<ies and
> optimizes drugs against a validated biological target (e.g., a protein
> like HIV protease). The course requires that you have a solid
> understanding of organic chemistry, particularly physical organic
> chemistry.

> Overview: Work with scientists, management and teammates to program
> and integrate sound, robust and ef\<icient solutions for scienti\<ic
> application that best suite our customer's distinct needs.
>
> Personal Role: Gather requirements from users and management, program

> gather feedback, perform and arrange maintenance.

Deployed many instances of ACAS to customers, provided maintenance,
backups, custom plug-ins, general support and custom con\<igurations.

Helped write and deploy a dose response curve \<itting algorithm using
R, that included automatic failing, curve classi\<ication and \<it
strategies (parameter \<ixing)

Wrote code to Extract, Transform and Load data from a vendor database to
a custom designed table in a customer database for use with a second
vendor's software. This project included spec gathering from two
different vendors, as well as speci\<ication for complex transformation
rules from the customer.

> Point contact between scientists and programmers.

Automated informatics software testing and monitoring processes by using
Redstone's Eggplant scripting language, which reduced the testing
procedures from a three person, one week process to a three hour
automated process.

Deployed a commercial Structure Activity Relationship query and chemical
display tool.

Gathered and negotiated user requirements, worked with the vendor and
in-house programmers to integrate the software with our in-house system
and database, performed primary end user training, provided
documentation and post training support.

Setup and maintained advanced queries. This replaced and enhanced the
work\<low for reporting and sharing SAR driving assay data, companywide.

Deployed a commercial dose response curve \<itting and curation tool
that replaced and enhanced the work\<low for curve \<itting and
signi\<icantly improved the integrity of the database.

Wrote and deployed an automated screening summary tool.

Project allowed scientists to get a quick and thorough summary of a
screening campaign for meetings and comparisons.

Helped write and deploy a curve \<itting algorithm and user interface
using R and Excel. This project saved the company over 100K in licensing
fees.
